### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Stephen from Dublin, Ireland.
#### Front End Developer, Software Engineer, Game Designer
![Game Designer and Senior Front End Developer](https://i.ibb.co/gPFBbdT/githubbanner.png)

I have 8 years of experience in software development. I have a passion for the visual side of things but love tinkering with how stuff works. I like to think of myself as a "backend" Front End Developer. Aside from web development, I have a history with mobile game creation, and even had a "hit" game on the iOS App Store [ZENFORMS: Protectors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxNpuetG8qI&ab_channel=CalisProjects).
Currently working for [bonkers.ie](https://www.bonkers.ie) as a Senior Front End Developer.
